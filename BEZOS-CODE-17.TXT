00:00-00:30
so I'm I'm really excited and happy to introduce the next guest Jeff Bezos Jeff have a safe so some really long time at 10 
00:30-01:00
this may remember that you did make an appearance here once it was like 2008 I think since I was like and if I remember correctly I think I did the interview just like this and I think the Kindle was pretty pretty much knew that that's about right because we're on our generation so right and we talked a lot about reading and electronic raining but you are now involved in so 
01:00-01:30
keep things that I don't know if 60 Minutes can cover it could be at the bar I'm just saying it's know the bars are locked so I'm just a whole bunch of things we can talk about and be very honest one of them is just the witch will get to is that you are 
01:30-02:00
you been around a long time and you're doing a lot of different things to so you have a a kind of landscape view of of tech and Innovation and what's going on and I want to get to that point to about some specific things first and the first one is artificial you become I've been around like I can remember some very early dinners with you 
02:00-02:30
yeah before you were rich and famous but artificial intelligence to start with you have a product actually a family products called Echo and they're driven by a platform called Alexa and you are actually licing that licensing that to some other people it's the election voice certainly exposed to different 
02:30-03:00
in case for Alexa one is the Alexa voice service which lets you embed through a set of api's embed Alexa in your own device or app and do with it what you want so you can have your if you make an alarm clock you can embed Alexa voice service in it and we have the Alexa skills kit which lets you teach Alexa new skills into those two things work to get a weekly email from you telling me the new skills 
03:00-03:30
other companies also have turned heavily toward a path that they say will leave them eventually to Fantastic games in a I threw machine learning some of them are Bots smart pots some of them are boys activated like Alexa and actually have a can have a camera or hopefully can have a conversation 
03:30-04:00
do you I'm sure know about Google's claims that there I conference where I personally thought that it was kind of a little bit above thanks Amazon for getting people excited now we're moving in here you know so I guess my first question is is this is this the the underpinnings of tech over the next 10 years as we seem to be emerging from the period of 
04:00-04:30
erratic growth and development in smartphone well I think it's I think it's gigantic I do I think natural language understanding I Hate Machine learning and general artificial intelligence this it's hard to overstate how big of an impact is going to have on society over the next 20 years so it it is big it is it doesn't mean that you know phones are going to go away or anything 
04:30-05:00
voice interfaces are going to replace screens so if you know people have eyes and as long as he will have as they will also want screens and then we have fingers would like to touch things and so on but it has been a dream ever since you know people started in on in the early days of Science Fiction to have a computer that you can talk to in a natural way and actually have a conversation with and ask it to do things for you and that is coming true and you're seeing similar 
05:00-05:30
amazing progress with Machine Vision where you know the the the the the combination of new and better algorithms vastly Superior compute power and the ability to harness huge amounts of training data those three things are coming together to solve some previously unsolvable problems and they're going to drive a tremendous amount of utility for customers and 
05:30-06:00
arms are going to adopt this thing's so is this at Amazon in particular are you deeply committed to this becoming a huge part of your business and what you do live been working on it and we worked on it kind of behind the scenes for 4 years we have more than a thousand people dedicated just to Alexa and Echo ecosystem we have now a big third set of third-party apps Alexa skills 
06:00-06:30
the people have built using restk and it's a and there's so much more to come it's just the tip of the iceberg of what you can do with these kind you're saying tip the iceberg the first entanglers it's the first inning and it's going to be so exciting to see what happened to the consumer I want who do you think of your competitors in this 
06:30-07:00
when did the first guys up at bat we don't really know what's going to happen five innings later but major tech companies will also be hundreds of start-up companies and there will be new advances one of the things the right now bigger companies like Amazon have an advantage because of the especially because of the training data sets that are required to do this so you need a lot of data to do extraordinary things with the current albums we have humans learn in a very different way so it's 
07:00-07:30
we don't yet know how humans are unbelievably data efficient we learn these incredibly complex things you know you don't have to drive a million miles to be able to drive a car act but the way we teach a self-driving car drive today is we have the algorithms drive a million miles and they're still not as good in certain scenarios as a human would be and so he went there doing all kinds of special things to make the possible roll some very powerful so you know alphago which is 
07:30-08:00
impressive achievement beat the world's best go player is you guys on. Alino but you know he's operating on about 50 Watts you know his it's if you have if if alphago had to be limited to 50 Watts heat of creamed it and so it's it's it's very interesting humans are just doing something fundamentally different from the current way do we do machine learning in machine intelligence 
08:00-08:30
important piece I think of the three things you mentioned obviously Google knows a lot about you Facebook knows a lot about you you know a lot about I guess certain that you know a lot about what books people want to read with things that people want to buy and I don't know maybe you know some other thing once housed other domains and what you doing to talk to you about in particular 
08:30-09:00
okay what about privacy at in other words we already have a pretty healthy privacy debate it's even more fierce in Europe about the collection of this data for put things much more mundane things like targeting advertising so I just recognize what are your camera guys hi Rick 
09:00-09:30
what about now that's just targeting advertise or or or Google showing allegedly showing their products that if somebody else is right this is going to get much deeper into our lives what what are the privacy and you haven't even touched on the other piece of this which makes it even more complicated what you see with apple and and you know the NSA and the FBI and you know cuz there are I think that if you take the towel 
09:30-10:00
if you no privacy and our ability to store large amounts of information to use it and weighs the customers actually do want us to use it so you know we're doing now dad's not you know when we make personal recommendations from people which we've been doing for almost twice now and we have to keep your purchase history to be able to do that so there are there are benefits I think one of the things that you 
10:00-10:30
what to do is when you collect and store data you have to be clear about what you're doing you have to and not just you know subsection 17 paragraph 3 clearly as you can see in our privacy policy we were allowed to do that you have to figure out ways to be kind of obviously clear so like what are the reasons we always wanted a green shoe my name on Amazon is so that we can soon as you come to the site see welcome back Jeff Bezos you know you're not Anonymous on our site 
10:30-11:00
can you know that in a way that would never be as clearly articulated by a set of terms and conditions because we're getting you by name we're showing your past purchases it's it's it's okay to the degree that you can arrange to have transparency combined with an explanation for what the consumer benefit is so that's through the commercial peace and then you get into the the tension between 
11:00-11:30
privacy and National Security and that's what you see you know we're very like-minded with apple on this point we filed an amicus brief on their behalf and but I think I believe that it is an issue of our age and that we as you know a citizen run democracy are going to have to deal with that and I think that the same principle should I laid out for commercial use to one degree of their may work there too 
11:30-12:00
what is a new script mean apples is not only reacted by pointing out that their stuff is encrypted in a crypt in their way that they don't even have the keys to decrypt it but there are hints from them that they're going to even and quit really know all the details but you know no matter as you can see you know you try to protect the phone up in the day 
12:00-12:30
on somebody's phone and you know turns out it's not as protected as you thought it was so when you're when you're in awe the bad guys get better and the good guys have to get better and that's good I don't think that's ever going to be resolved per say it's going to be kind of a continuous cat-and-mouse game and and the bad guys are always going to get better in the good guys are always going to get better too we just have to try and stay ahead in that race you're doing devices and now they're smart getting smarter and other people are going to be 
12:30-13:00
and it's very early but you're still in the retail business you're still in the business somewhere in multiple multiple things that we do but certainly one of our very important businesses is our retail business okay so we really like the business encourage you to shop early and often don't feel bad there's just a lot going on there but one of the things 
13:00-13:30
I wanted to ask you about was whole shipping and infrastructure piece because the idea of Amazon for many years was I could buy it online and it would get delivered to me sometimes very quickly I mean personally I'm utterly astonished sometimes at this box shows up on Sunday and I only bought it Saturday at 7 and it's theirs on Sunday yeah that's pretty cool but that's not your truck that's a 
13:30-14:00
can you ask sir whatever it depends on where you are in the timing to take over that last mile or that last few miles but we're aiming to supplement at heavily so what's happened is this happened first in UK the real meal ran out of capacity at Peak so we have to plan just like you know any company would we have to have 
14:00-14:30
not for the average load but for the peak and in countries that have holiday selling Seasons just most countries there is a very big peak head of the whatever the annual gift-giving holidays in that country and nnnn so we have had to take over a lot of the last mile delivery in the UK over the last several years and we're about half of it now doing it ourselves and we're 
14:30-15:00
in certain parts of the US we're doing a lot of last mile delivery it still very small compared to the UK but it's not it's not it's not that we're trying FedEx business or No in fact what we want I mean what was like better prices in that would be yeah but I'm what what I'm really saying is that we are driven to supplement their 
15:00-15:30
we will take all of the capacity that the u.s. Postal Service can give us and that UPS can give us and we still need to supplement it so we're not cutting that we're growing our business with UPS we're growing our business with US Postal Service and still were supplementing it and I predicted that will continue for some time as long as you guys keep shopping thank you but no what is the deal with these brick-and-mortar bookstores the ones 
15:30-16:00
opening it is we will open one when we've announced the second one in San Diego the first we will probably open some more we want to there still just open a few to begin with and we're learning and we've got a few experiments that were rolling out over time to trying to figure out what the right format is what the right 
16:00-16:30
lower sizes with the right approaches in general you know how it should interact with having a Prime membership and old it like there's a bunch of things that you what we want to try inside the stores and already we like what we're finding you know where the store is many of you probably have not been there there's only one store it's in the University Village Mall in Seattle but it's very different from any books for the 202 has a very small selection very highly curated only about 5,000 titles and 
16:30-17:00
time in there are all face out on the sauce and they're mostly they're picked based on the data that we have an Amazon so from the from the website end in N it's if you come to the Amazon physical bookstore with a specific title in mind that you want to buy is a very good chance because we have such a curated selection that you'll be disappointed but why would we build a store that's designed to if you know exactly what you want to buy we already have this thing called amazon.com that's a very very good 
17:00-17:30
satisfying not need it so this is about satisfying to complete different need it's about browsing and Discovery and having a really fun space to wander around in and I definitely encourage people to if you're just curious about kind of the angles that were taking you should when you're in see all the bookstore said when you started killing them 10 years ago where we going to have fun and we serve espresso and you can walk around and find a book 
17:30-18:00
which point book stores are sort of rebounding is they are so you know that's not really they did say that question but I think some people did for us it seems normal cuz we never think of ourselves as tied to any particular technology or skill set we think of ourselves as tied to our customers and we're trying to work backwards from there needs it will learn whatever skills we need to service our customers and so we had some ideas who I 
18:00-18:30
experiment with in the physical world and and that's what we're doing Amazon irony books that would a good name I like a lot of clever people over it or not too late and 
18:30-19:00
I would just say I was just observe that the Washington Post was very thin and doing a lot less Enterprise kind of Journalism they once did any now they're thicker and doing more and have more people yet what what's your goal there why are you doing it how can you do it how can you change it it's the goal is really simple 
19:00-19:30
a post because technically about the post because I've been friends with Don gram for 15 years if I hadn't been friends with Don Graham and never would have happened for a whole bunch of reasons but when he proposed it to me the I was nervous that I didn't know anything about the newspaper business and he said look Jeff we've got a lot of people who know about the newspaper business we really needed somebody who knows something about the internet and and so anyway he had to he kind of had several 
19:30-20:00
stations with me and we work through whether I thought I could actually bring anything to the table but but the reason I finally bought it is because I think it's an important institution and I would not have bought it if it had been a financially upside down it's not salty snack food company I would not have bought it and I happen to believe it's a very important it's it's the end of the paper that is best situated because of its geography to cover the capitals 
20:00-20:30
when the most important country in the world and that country now more than ever always it's needed but it needs to visit you know our elected leaders and all the people in DC that run most of the country need to be examined and that's a great paper to do that mmm what do you bring to it it's different cuz I've been friends with done for at least 15 years strategy-wise and he never offered it to me Jeff yeah I can't explain that 
20:30-21:00
thanks Planet I think it was he just you know okay what can you do for that with that what you described so I believe that the business strategy of the Washington Post for many decades was fantastic because they were incredibly clear that there were 
21:00-21:30
how to be a local paper and date from a business point of view that was an amazingly effective strategy that paper was so profitable for so long and made so much money it was a very good strategy the internet turned out upside down for a whole bunch of reasons that would take more than the hour that we have would have to spend the whole conversation to go over all the reasons why the internet has turned local newspapers upside down but 
21:30-22:00
send what the post has to do is a very difficult but I think for the Post doable transition I'm optimistic I'm even more optimistic today than I was two years ago when I bought the paper and that is we have to go from a business model where we used to make a relatively large amount of money per reader with a relatively small number of readers to a model where we make a relatively small amount of money per reader but I'm a very large number of reader he reminds me of Amazon so we have the 
22:00-22:30
exactly right and we have to go with the good news is for all of the things that the internet took away from the medium the traditional medium business one of the gifts that it brought is almost zero cost global distribution so you know if you wanted to go back in time you know 10 years or 20 years we've been very very expensive to decide I'm going to have a Global newspaper and printing plants everywhere in distribution facility challenging 
22:30-23:00
now that's a fixed expense to do that is almost zero so is the Washington Post going to become a truly Global newspaper we're working to become National and to some degree Global newspaper and for people who are interested in the job lot of higher priorities than that because there's a still a lot of the English-speaking world 
23:00-23:30
available to us we don't need to translate it for why people in the United States as a newspaper publisher you get to answer the Peter teal question I'm excited so the question is what ever you think of Gawker media can you can you can say what you think of it if you want but whatever you think of it do you think somebody who happens to be a billionaire 
23:30-24:00
I want to be able to fund a series of lawsuits regardless of their Merit whose real purpose is to put that company out of business and Destroy them for personal reasons I don't and I will my view on this and I can get I don't know the details of this particular situation I don't think I really need to cuz I'm thinking of take it up a level and talk about the some of the principles that I think would have been my mind would apply here 
24:00-24:30
and look you know I can take this from couple directions but you know the old saying that sometimes I think it's attributed to Confucius who knows if it's really Confucius or not but seek revenge and you should dig two graves one for yourself and really you just want 
24:30-25:00
how do you want to spend your time your energy and do they want to do that trying to write some if it's legitimate wrong like let's say that somebody actually did wrong you is that really how you want to spend your time I don't think so I think most people of the step back take a deep breath they would say I'm going to go on and do great things you do amazing things in the future then from the I would also say that public figure you know 
25:00-25:30
look figure the best defense against getting this is not about Peter or Gawker or any particular thing but the best defense to to speech that you don't like about yourself as a public figure is to develop a thick skin it's really the only effective defense because you can't stop it you know you're are going to be misunderstood 
25:30-26:00
anything interesting in the world you're going to have critics the only if you absolutely can't tolerate critics the don't do anything new or interesting and then you can insulate yourself and think how wonderful your life will that the Bezos so I would just say you know it's it's it's it's it's not move forward it's not worth losing any sleep over and an inn in by the way 
26:00-26:30
can usually people when you if you see something I don't know you're kind of a public figure you probably things are prime been written about you that you didn't think we're nice it's true and in my office you know somebody wrote this it really hurt my feelings what should I do I would say go stand on a street corner watch in crowded urban area and watch all the people walk by and think about what they're thinking about I bet you none of those people are thinking about you 
26:30-27:00
true and they're all thinking about people thinking about where that busy street corner all those people you know maybe I had somebody Russell me I don't like you know like that it's not true it's wrong I think about that mad at me is it my wife sent to Jeff is unhappy wait 5 minutes 
27:00-27:30
I want to go I would go at least as a happy long enough to pick up Trey better watch it so I might switch to 9 NN so it you know you if you stay on that street corner and it really it in your mind you can do this thought experiment like okay there's a woman who just walked by what she actually thinking about probably much my baby what she is going to cook for dinner that night 
27:30-28:00
or the argument that she had with one of her employees or whatever it is like it's not about us and if you kind of just take that step back and then there's the the kind of free speech against the final thing you didn't want to answer this long I apologize but I'm passionate about this you always have to remember this country has the best free speech Protections in the world 
28:00-28:30
because of the Constitution but also because of our cultural norms and you don't want to a road those you don't want to create any kind of climate of fear or chill with respect to free speech norms and so and that in the most important thing to remember about that is that beautiful speech doesn't need protection it's ugly speech that needs protection so of course that's where the rubber is going to meet the road 
28:30-29:00
do you know if somebody's going to write something very ugly and certain people so will they need to be punished for that ugly speech and but probably not really if you step back and think about what a great society we have in the big part of it is the fact that we have these cultural norms that allow people to say it really ugly things we don't have to like it we don't have to invited people to our dinner parties there's also you know but but you should let him say it thanks 
29:00-29:30
so little while back you are Amazon was criticized for having a harsh work culture and I'm just wondering if an an you you guys came out and defended yourselves and explained it I have kind of a two-part question 1 is 
29:30-30:00
whether it is whether it's you considered it fair at all or not whether it made you rethink anything about your work culture and the second question is a little bit of a setup I need to tell all of you cuz I know you have a unemployed program that you wanted to talk about really has not I'm very proud of the culture that we have at Amazon 
30:00-30:30
and you know it's it's a I think of it as a gold standard culture for Innovation and pioneering work and the you know in the people I work with the people who they're missionaries for what they do they are in if you're giving great customer experience there's only way to do that is with happy people you can't do it with a set of miserable people 
30:30-31:00
you know watching the clock all day so does that include work-life balance and all those things yes but they're bigger classes but I come in and teach a session and I always talk about work-life balance except I like to use the phrase work-life Harmony rather than balance because to me balance implies a strict trade whereas I find 
31:00-31:30
when I am happy at work I come home more energized my better husband better dad and when I'm happy home I come in and a better boss and better colleague and so that that it's not you can be out of work and have terrible work-life balance you know even though you got all the time in the world you could just feel like oh my God you know I'm 
31:30-32:00
miserable and you would be draining energy and so you have to find that Harmony it's a much better word and I think for most people it's about meaning people want to know that they're doing something interesting and useful and for us either because of the challenges that we have chosen for ourselves we get to work in the future and it's super fun to work in the future for the right kind of people I mean who you know 
32:00-32:30
ours is an environment that Embraces lot of change we have to because the internet is changing the technologies that we use or changing Opry at the intersection of of technology and Retail both of which are highly competitive Industries and but it's really for somebody who hated change you know I imagine high-tech would be a pretty bad career it would be it would be very tough you know the in there are much more stable Industries and so they should I choose one of those more stable 
32:30-33:00
trees with less change and they probably be happier there I'd be that industry would be tough for me so we're not all the same and for me a job that I don't know like for me the job that would be the harm you like I don't understand just something you know where I had the same job everyday and it didn't change frequently I do it but I do it at a high quality level by wouldn't like it and iPads now even stop I'm just saying there's a little okay 
33:00-33:30
Princeton Ohio Machine learning to that's right the second there's a second thing about your your work culture this program that you that I learned about when we are we are we're doing this now and we're just in the process of open sourcing at so I wanted to bring it to your attention it's it's called career choice and I'm I'm you know kind of on the road 
33:30-34:00
dredging companies especially bigger companies Fortune 1000 companies that have big employee bases to come to Amazon learn what we have learned and see if any of it fits would fit into your company career choices for our fulfillment centers and what we have done is we have put together a training program that teaches people in demand careers in in demand Fields where 
34:00-34:30
high paying jobs could be airplane mechanic or nursing or commercial truck driver driving big rig 18 wheelers which is very lucrative job and very expensive it's anywhere from 4 to $6,000 to go through the training to get a license to do that so we have it at Amazon a bunch of entry-level people in our fulfillment centers who for some of whom they'll stay with us in the bill to clear with us but for many of them it's a stepping stone on the way somewhere else and what we want is for them to have a choice 
34:30-35:00
airplane mechanic in the key there couple of key things when is you have to pre pay the tuition because it's really hard for people to even if you were going to reimburse them it's hard in many cases for entry-level employees to pull together five or six thousand dollars in a lump sum to pay for the cost of this kind of training so you prepay it we prepay it and then and then what in the thing that we didn't do with the very beginning but we started doing after about a year it has worked really well as we build the classrooms in the Fulfillment centers in 
35:00-35:30
mainstream areas behind glass walls and so all their co-workers walk by every day and they see their co-workers inside learning how to be nurses and airplane mechanics and commercial truck drivers and they start thinking hey maybe I should do that so it's that putting the classrooms right kind of on the plant floor is a big learning for us and we not have 7,000 people engaged in the program 
35:30-36:00
we have some very successful graduates Who come out the pipeline at the end and it gives people I think it's really good for the company it's great for the employee but it's really good for the company because the last thing that any enlightened company wants is for any employee in their company to kind of feel trapped in that job you want people to have a choice if they want to be there are great but if they want to be a nurse then help him do that so they can go 
36:00-36:30
nurse do you have colleges involved in this right we don't pay for non and demand Fields so this is another thing we have nothing against it but we use the Bureau of Labor Statistics data and other data sources and we have a list and so because you know one of the points here is we want to chain you and something where you can then leave and go get a higher-paying job somewhere and so sorry I was just you have educational staticians College 
36:30-37:00
turn in coordination with local community colleges that service the neighborhoods were we have fulfillment centers teach us how to do it so if anybody is interested you can email me in I'm Jeff at amazon.com and you'll read this somebody by only email and I see every email I don't respond to everyone but I do see everyone so you're also an in addition to all the 
37:00-37:30
Rivard talked about your immediate company outside of the Washington Post your fuel Prime service you have a lot of video including a lot of original video that you do you're doing now you have a music service that is some somewhat less important to you smaller it's not Spotify or apple music size but your video service is a big deal yeah Prime video talk about that where is it going 
37:30-38:00
is the big change coming in the television if you know it is to be if you go back in time 10 years ago you couldn't get any A-list actors or really a list writers to do TV was very difficult an order actors and now you're sort everybody wants to do cerealized TV and because it's in some ways and better media 
38:00-38:30
the movie you can tell longer stories binge-watching makes it easy from people to watch the thing all at once if they want to so there's a lot of there's a lot that's changing with roof what has come to be called over the top TV witches you know ribs are by Netflix and Amazon Prime video and Hulu and not Starz and Showtime and everybody is kind of humbling and going over the top and set this is great for consumers because consumers want that they want that to be on bundle 
38:30-39:00
want to go in and pick and choose what they want to watch and so we started you know we had we had this program called Amazon Prime which is one of the three pillars of our business currently we have Marketplace we have our third-party sorry business that's one have Amazon Prime in who have Amazon web services those are kind of three existing big pillars and we're working on some others to will see if they have if they turn out we don't know we won't ask me in 10 years but but we have Amazon Studios it's not making 
39:00-39:30
Channel content for Prime video and that's going extraordinary well we've got you know multiple Golden Globe winning comedies we've got incredible success in the show called man in the High Castle which is by far our creepiest show and I highly recommended it to show where you know Hitler won World War II and occupies the east coast of the US after having destroyed Washington DC with atomic bomb in 1945 
39:30-40:00
Revenant fighting hand-to-hand throughout the country until 1940 and very interesting and so does this the what from a business point of you for us where we get to monetize that content in a very unusual way because when we win a Golden Globe it helps us sell more shoes and it does it in a very direct way 
40:00-40:30
this it would people if you look at Prime members they they buy more on Amazon the non Prime members and one of the reasons they do that is once they've paid their no fee there looking around to see how can I get more value of program and so they look across more categories they shop more than do a lot of their behaviour change in ways that are very attractive to us as business and the in the customers utilize more of our services and so it's we really want to do things that will 
40:30-41:00
cause you know free trial conversion to go up some people start Amazon Prime as a free trial member and we watch the free child conversion rates and and then we want people to renew at the end of the year when it's time for their primary ship to renew and we already had extraordinary good free child conversion and extraordinaire Lee good renewal rates when it was a physical program fast free shipping was the founding benefit of Amazon Prime and people really like that and I grew into a very large successful 
41:00-41:30
program but we've been able to monitor the people who use Prime video change those two metrics they renew higher rates and they convert from free trials or doing the media stuff to encourage people to use more of prime correct I mean that is a flywheel so it's always a little bit wrong to say you know which one is pushing you 
41:30-42:00
is there cuz they're pushing each other it's a hot it's now become a physical digital hybrid membership program that you know isn't it it's unlike anything else they're hybrid digital programs obviously really good ones and but there's nothing quite like Prime and so what we do the way we think about it internally as we just want you to be a Prime member and then you get the bestest song so put on the media piece on the particular on the video piece of where you're doing these programs 
42:00-42:30
can you have other programs for you where you're trying to be bigger than Netflix or bigger than Comcast on the demand side anyway we don't compete don't compete with Netflix for the reason I think people are going to subscribe to both so I don't think you know some 
42:30-43:00
what's a really substitute products and people make a decision you know if I'm going to buy a pickup truck I'm going to buy a Ford pickup truck or a semi pickup truck but I'm not going to buy both and but you know when it comes to these over-the-top subscriptions I think people are going to subscribe to Netflix and Prime video and Hulu and HBO and so on and you're not but but but you're we do compete with these other guys on the supply side so we 
43:00-43:30
what we bid against each other I get it but but you're you're building the flywheel you're not building you know what we used to be primarily retail now we're going to be primarily a TV I think the way to think about it from the consumers point of you is it because we have this unusual way to monetize the premium content that we can charge less for the premium content than we would otherwise have to charge if we 
43:30-44:00
have the Flywheel spinning to help sell more shoes so you have another thing going on it's close to your heart which is space Oh yeah that is close to my lawn muscular tomorrow he is the other guy well known for doing private recoverable what's the difference between your companies and why are you doing it and will what's wrong with NASA you know 
44:00-44:30
I'm doing it because really come on when I was in when I was in high school they used to show us I'll tell you guys from NASA tears will you don't choose your passions here you know your passion passion about space and rocket since I was a five year old boy so it's not a you know that it's some level that's why I'm doing it but but but I have I also think it's very important and I would put it in an entrepreneurial context 
44:30-45:00
which is the if you look at the dynamism in the space industry it's very slow very little has happened it's been in stasis for 50 years by large you know we do globally in a good year about 40 launches 440 that's down from the peak the number of launches per year isn't even flat it's down 
45:00-45:30
pcap and maybe in the 70s and so why is that why isn't there that kind of dynamism I compare it to the internet you know if you look at my day job there's a lot of dinosaur sounds of entrepreneurs and you can't even keep track of it to be in the middle of an industry that so Dynamic that no matter how hard you try you can't keep track of it that's awesome 
45:30-46:00
and the the what's that all about you know what I started Amazon with me and a few other people I was driving the packages myself hoping one day to be able to afford a forklift and and 20 years later we serve almost 300 million customers and have you know 100 billion plus in sales and we're just one company in this gigantic thing that didn't exist two decades ago 
46:00-46:30
what's the big gorillas from the dynamism space you get why is that I think I know why if you if you go back to when I started Amazon all of the heavy lifting infrastructure to support Amazon was already in place we did not have to invent a remote payment system it was already there what's called the credit card and it was invented much earlier for people who travel a lot and then from people who went to restaurants a lot 
46:30-47:00
someone finally most people that time already had a credit card we did not have to invent Transportation you know Local transportation last while there was this thing called the US Postal Service and UPS which was not invented for e-commerce but if we had had to deploy Last Mile Transportation 20 years ago would have cost hundreds of billions of dollars of capital would have been impossible for a company like Amazon even conceive of doing that same thing to pulling compute infrastructure 
47:00-47:30
there was already a computer on every desk and it wasn't put on every desk so that people can do eCommerce other ones in the whole some people can play games and there was also how did the internet grow so fast even there the heavy lifting infrastructure had already been done for another purpose which was the long-distance phone network the all of the fiber in the grounds at that time and all the ways the older microwave Communications towers and all the things that exist in two decades ago or put 
47:30-48:00
play it's another reason again would have been hundreds of billions of dollars of capex deployed so when it comes to space I see it as my job this is what I'm I'm building infrastructure the hard way I'm using my resources to put in place heavy lifting in infrastructure so that the next generation of people can have a dynamic entrepreneurial explosion into space and I think that's possible 
48:00-48:30
and I believe I know what the what you need to do to put that infrastructure in place so that future generations of entrepreneurs can have a solar system as Dynamic and interesting and varied as what we see on the internet today I want thousands of entrepreneurs doing things in space and to do that we have to lower the cost of access to space right now only the most expensive things can logically and reasonably be done in space basically 
48:30-49:00
you can fight any other way to do it you should do it a different way and it's just too expensive even the least expensive I mean you can do a little Cube SATs and things in hitch a ride but there's just only so much they can do and how are you different in your point of view from Elon one of the things that I want us to do is go to Mars but for me it's one of the things he's singerly focused on that 
49:00-49:30
I have and I also think kind of you no motivation was I I don't like the from me I don't find that plan B idea motivating you know the thing wrong with I think it's good when the world has lots of different motivations and but I don't want a plan B for earth I want Plan B today make sure plan a works and add this is I think you go to space to save Earth and we know about 
49:30-50:00
car system that we have sent robotic probes all over the solar system let me assure you this is the best planet in this those I rarely how you sure about that strong conviction about things but let me assure you of that and we need to protect it and the way we will protect this planet is by going out into space and you don't want to live in a retrograde world you don't want to live 
50:00-50:30
on an Earth where we have to freeze population growth reduce energy you lization you enjoy we all enjoy a extraordinary civilization it is powered by energy and its power by population centers are so Dynamic we want the population to keep growing on this planet using more energy per capita and by the way it would be completely immoral of us to Civil War just kind of 
50:30-51:00
energy utilization where it is because the other 7 billion people who are just now coming online to more energy usage they we have you know they want to flights that takes a lot of energy so we do want to keep using energy and energy is limited here you can do a simple calculation if you take Baseline Global energy utilization today and grow it at just 3% a year the power of compounding is so 
51:00-51:30
Jordan Air within just a few hundred years you will have to cover all of the land mass of Earth and solar cells just 3% compounding and just a few hundred years so what are you going to do well I think what you're going to do is you're going to move out his face this will happen or you know in over the next few hundred years we all of our heavy industry will be moved off planet and Earth will be zoned residential and light Industrial 
51:30-52:00
and that just makes a lot of sense that you shouldn't be doing heavy industry on Earth Resources are more plentiful and Spain for the Zone energy care watching mayor of one of the city and then you send a little vitamin static chip factories in space and then just a little bit's down we don't need to actually build them here and this planet is very hard to get energy you know even if he using solar power because the Earth Shades it's 
52:00-52:30
you only get sore power for half the day in space you can get sore power 24/7 so their line would you put the particular Planet the problem with other planets and will do all of that given time you know and and and people will visit Mars and people will settle Mars and we should because it's cool and so but but but for heavy industry I would actually put 
52:30-53:00
space the transit time between Earth and Mars is long and just speeded up requires unreasonable amounts of energy question be honestly I could take another hour of your time but I'd be interested in knowing what you expect to be doing you expect to be doing in 5 years well I tap dance into work I love 
53:00-53:30
my job and so I took my wife's family my parents-in-law and they're kind of extended family to the south of France on awesome vacation and we had a great time and eat amazing food and played in beaches and stay off the grid good at staying off the grid on vacation and and I and I and I got back 
53:30-54:00
and despite all the fun I'd had and I really don't happen to like my in-laws so it really was fun despite all of that when I got back I literally ran into the office so I feel incredibly lucky and you notes so I'm doing the same thing 5 years from now all be doing those those projects things 
54:00-54:30
are wandering matters I like to wander I like to you know go down blind alleys and okay but you mentioned very quickly tonight agendas I don't like a Titan genda on my meetings because Titan genders assume you know where you're going which for a certain kind of meeting is right you know if you're doing like a weekly Business review and you're going through a metrics deck that should have a good agenda but most meetings are not like that most meetings should 
54:30-55:00
news for a kind of mild brainstorming or some like that we're really doing a lot of wandering and wandering is when you know is super important did there's a knowing thinking you know exactly where you're going is is is a kind of lack of humility that doesn't let you invent and so the wandering and I like that's why I like you know the Washington Post is a is for curious person playground I'm learning so much about the newsgathering business I didn't know anything about it 
55:00-55:30
lots of opportunity to to wander and explore their and certainly blue origin and building reusable spacecraft and it's incredible incredible journey and then Amazon is this you know in the middle of one of a handful of companies in the middle of what is the most amazing amount of uncontrolled dynamism I think the world has yet seen it going back to the five years so you're going to be in the same job 
55:30-56:00
you mention very quickly and non-specific I don't think so full of years my wife hates the phrase empty nest she thinks it's very negative and so I have 4 Kids the oldest is sick so your word is super grab her word I like it a lot though it's super grown-ups instead of empty nest so you didn't think of that way you can look forward to when your last 
56:00-56:30
man goes off to school you can be like just for finally super grown ups and then you can you can travel together and do more things together and you know I never thought of that my wife's here that's my wife's I'm going to ask her immediately after you guys were super spy promise 5 years during those five years you mentioned very 
56:30-57:00
replaying the conversation any of these three pillars and some other things you were working yet what are they there but then you see them and it's hard to tell at this stage there I think of the Missoula seeds we planted and we'll see what they turn into big trees and some get in Amazon Studios I think Amazon Studios could turn into a 4th floor it's possible lower doing with Alexa and Echo and natural language understanding and that involves into an artificially in 
57:00-57:30
was an agent by the way I think they're going to be a bunch of artificially intelligent agents in the world I don't think I think you're going to find just a bit like apps and websites that this they're going to be Specialties and you made an ass the same guy for everything at some guys may be better at certain things than others and until you might you know I bet the average household will use a number of these and so that to me that's very exciting seeing that we planted in 
57:30-58:00
I love working on stuff like that and the team is brilliant and you know it's true of our Studios team is true of our natural language understanding team that's just so many other teams we don't know about well obviously give you any I can't give you any promising to me will thanks 
58:00-58:30
can we have some questions mark mahaney so on that fourth pillar you'll figure it out in 10 years like what are you going to be using to figure out whether it's orrible overtime and then it sound like earlier maybe like like a parcel business didn't seem like it be one of those pillows but anything else that's obviously you wouldn't include that just doesn't seem to make sense for you you know the times of things that I think are probably unlikely for us to pursue I mean even though there be giant into 
58:30-59:00
reason would be very interesting and so on but they're the price of admission in those Industries is so gigantic I mean you know the obvious you know their menu can just go down the list of of large market cap companies were very big Industries don't want to personally think it would be very challenging to get into the business of oil exploration and production you know it's a very it's a very complicated industry that is as far as I can see streamly well sir 
59:00-59:30
by really smart people at ExxonMobil and so on and so so they're the landscape is gigantic and we will ever only enter into the tiniest little portion of that gigantic landscape so it's kind of hard to know I'll tell you how we decide to give up on ideas so if we worked on something for a long time we tend to because it's hard to know when do you stop in a I think 
59:30-00:00
every single important thing we've ever done the most important things have always seemed dumb to Industry experts at the beginning so you have to get really good results you have to be if to defy conventional wisdom and the problem of course is the conventional wisdom is usually correct and so a simple task like let's go talk to ask experts and ask them if we should do Amazon web services that would be a huge 
00:00-00:30
they would all tell you this is stupid stick to the knitting you got a great retail business whatever you do don't do this AWS thing it's that you know you can't possibly work and of course that would have been wrong and so you can't listen to people at the beginning when they say it won't work but you do have to sort of so what are we doing differently let's go now let's say you you're being stubborn on the vision and flexible on the details which I think is the right recipe 
00:30-01:00
you want always to be very flexible on the tactics in the details but very stubborn on the vision in the strategy and at some point though you may need to give up even on the vision so you planted the seed you're a great teams worked on it for multiple years how do you know when what is that day were you say you know what let's try the next one I think it's when the last time judgment Champion folds his or her cards and so 
01:00-01:30
I'm willing to keep funding things if if if there's one high judgment champion who still wants to keep trying and I think that's extremely important because I think most companies especially larger companies give up on things too soon and and win the last sometimes I'm The Last Judgement Champion then it should I start to wonder if I'm high judgment and and 
01:30-02:00
so that's another good time to fold the cards maybe but you should give up on things but you shouldn't give up easily okay Rob conversation so I was surprised that Walt didn't bring this up and it's very unpleasant might run over B's appetite but seems important Donald Trump and I'm actually the next thing on my list but the clock 
02:00-02:30
would be a disaster in how many people share that and also my judgment I've been saying this for about 6 months I think he has about a 50-50 chance of getting elected you famously took him on when he attacked you you unfairly and unreasonably and Amazon and I'm curious now that he's the presumptive Republican nominee what's your perspective on the dichotomy between Jeff as a business leader of 100 billion dollar company Revenue company that has to be successful whether or not he's president and Jeff as a citizen that carries should 
02:30-03:00
what about the planet our society and what do you think we should do and what each what do you think you're going to do well my response to that is on this narrow Point actually it's very similar to what we were talking about earlier which is one thing that I think is not appropriate that the the the Donald Trump is doing is I think working to freeze or chill the media 
03:00-03:30
that are examining him you know it's it's it's just the fact that we live in a world where half the population on this planet if you criticize Your Leader there's a good chance you'll go to jail or worse and we live in this amazing democracy with amazing freedom of speech and a presidential candidate should embrace that 
03:30-04:00
I should say I'm running for president of the most important country in the world I expect to be scrutinized please examine me that's a very important cultural norm and the cultural norms are without the cultural norms the Constitution is just a piece of paper therefore therefore it's 
04:00-04:30
I certainly will you you're asking me about my own behavior you know the all of our beer probably 50% would be discussed with both choices but I don't think I think this the tech World which is very much knowledge based in progress based doesn't like somebody that's is a scientific in a historical in look let me tell you what I'll get Catherine Graham the previous 
04:30-05:00
owner of the Washington Post during the Watergate years was threatened by Haldeman who famously said and I will leave out a bit of the quote because it's too crude to say and on stage but he said you tell K gram if she prints that will put her blank through a big fat ringer and 
05:00-05:30
and then they actually worked to the Nixon Administration worked to try and get on TV stations and they tried to get their broadcast licenses rescinded it's it's completely on American and so you know I guess the only thing I would say is this the with cane gram as my role model I'm very willing to let any of my body parts go through a big fat ringer 
05:30-06:00
if need be straight answer over here yes sir John Ford from CNBC question about tight agendas versus wandering witcha mentions interesting but applied to your retail business a couple years ago I asked you about brick-and-mortar stores and what it would take for you to actually roll those out and you said 
06:00-06:30
something like what we'd have to find something really special and different that we could do that's right where we did that now you're doing it in Seattle your San Diego and and more to come what is that thing that you found that has led you to really continue exploring brick mortar what you are if you go look at that other know if you had a chance to visit that store yet or not but what you'll find there is that the browsing experience is reinvented and 
06:30-07:00
punch a very small things it's that the books are all face out on the shelves is it the creation is very small is the reason the data from amazon.com to select the titles so for example almost every book in the store has five stars unless it's there for a different reason so we also have liked the top 100 best sellers I think they're whatever they are but so it's their bunch of very small things and it makes him very big difference in the customer experience but it is 
07:00-07:30
it's something that's easier to experience that there's something about the physical space that allow the way it's laid on during and kind of demand creation that you can't even say what are the things that many observers have noted overtime you know there are many Discovery methods online so I'm learning about new books online all the time and you certainly are personal recommendations do that but you know I see tweets about books and I see all sorts of 
07:30-08:00
when's of Discovery going on and tons of serendipity and but there was always one you know that kind of serendipity that you get from just wandering around bookshelves looking at book covers is is is it going to be yet another kind of serendipity and I think that's part of what we're trying to do in a kind of way that's accelerated with the data from amazon.com text John I'm from India so we missed it 
08:00-08:30
the conversation India you said that when you started Amazon us head turn off intersection on multiple aspects of India seems to be not having that and you doing incredibly all day so what are you like long with the law of inference exit investment in India we do most of our last mile Transportation are so you know it's a wouldn't be our first choice for 
08:30-09:00
how to do it but it's the only choice and so that's what we do we also try to travel shorter distances so we open many more smaller fulfillment centers instead of having you know larger ones slightly more distant so we're kind of adapting to the local model and also the regulations and India are very different so it has to be a 3-piece sales model all of our sales in India are Marketplace sales we don't have any of what internally with 
09:00-09:30
loaned inventory yes I walked Jeff great conversation my questions about retail and I used to be used to work for a Bentonville base retailer before and we used to watch how amazonfresh is rolling out and I think Prime now is probably the thing that should keep Grocers up at night if you want to grocery store Zoo there's a lot of innovation in terms of fulfillment and assortment and all those kinds of things I'm curious when you look in 10 years 
09:30-10:00
20 years out what are the big problems that you know that you're excited about kind of applying Amazon scaling in January to in retail that you think will fundamentally transform experience Beyond where it's come in the last 20 years which is pretty phenomenal well I think that the the three big needle movers in my opinion we've thought this for 20 years our selection price and 
10:00-10:30
deliver delivery convenience delivery speed and an associate of attributes and I think there's still a lot of progress to be made on those things and then I think I also Discovery living if you get category by category there's tons of invention remaining I'm very excited about apparel and fashion because I think that's the product category were you can do so much invention online so I don't over 20 or time frame 
10:30-11:00
Dick's that selection price and delivery accuracy and speed will still be major drivers you know it's impossible for me to imagine 20 years from now the customer saying I love Amazon I just wish you delivered a little more slowly or I love Amazon I just wish you had less selection or wish your prices were little higher you know so when you find it I would I would urge all of you in your own businesses to think about that 
11:00-11:30
I think about what are the things that you know will be true even 10 years from now because if those are stable and time unlike everything else everything else you're competitive set will change your check the technologies that you have available to you will change but the customer needs if you find the right ones we'll tend to be stable and time and then you can build strategies around those things and all the energy that we put into making sure that we're delivering quickly will still be paying dividends 10 years from now 
11:30-12:00
is it won't ever go out of style Jason Delray B Commerce reporter for recode who's been in China for a long time now and it's been it's been a rough road and in a lot of ways and India you've been in for about 3 years now two different markets but two very critical markets internationally Brown and two completely different results and so God 
12:00-12:30
I was wondering if there are if there were any learnings from the approach in China that has as markets as completely different so I think some of the investors in India in the early days thought that India might be a replay of China and that has they have found out that has not it hasn't gone that way our team 
12:30-13:00
India has just done unbelievable job and there's the bunch of reasons why it's different China to very long conversation it's not one thing it really is it's you know it's 50 little things but but our team is Just Desserts huge Kudos and congrats in India because you know I've been told that some some people who worked on the China business early on have visited into an 
13:00-13:30
are we some lessons we have done more local market customization in India then we did in China in China we did we did some local market customization but we tried we mostly tried to roll out what had worked well for us in Japan Germany 
13:30-14:00
UK Spain France Italy the us excetera and it needed more local customization and so that's but you know I'd say that if you have to if you want me to pick one metal lesson it's that one that we needed in India and that team we gave him all around software Engineers I asked him to be in a fast-acting Cowboy this instead of calm clear-headed computer scientist and they 
14:00-14:30
what does instructions will just do it awarded Amazon we can give a Nike shoe to people who have invented things that nobody asked him to do when they just did it they give away a cowboy hat and India instead they have just there just an amazing job thank you so I have to ask you a question stop the mics are you going to clear the Mike's or do you have to go 
14:30-15:00
how many in that may come from your folks nobody else we have to respect his time and he's already way over nilai concise my good friend unarmed you said Prime video drives people to buy more shoes why is there a Prime video app for the Apple TV why don't you 
15:00-15:30
the ChromeCast News store want you trying to go wider with that business if you're just converting it into shoe sales discussion to have in a lot of the most a lot of the parts of that discussion you know I think Private Business discussions should stay private so I'll do that and so I can give you too much there but there are there are 
15:30-16:00
not easy to put we don't want to sell police a Roku Xbox whistle PlayStation competitive products on Amazon we do it all day we you know we sell Nest thermostats we do sell Apple TVs on Amazon do we okay I don't know and I don't know but but but 
16:00-16:30
what we do when we saw those devices if you want the simplest version of this when we saw this devices we want our player our Prime video player to be on the device and we want it to be on the device with acceptable business terms and so you can always get the player on the device the question is can you do so with acceptable business terms and if you can't then you know 
16:30-17:00
we don't want to start to our customers because you know they're going to be buying at thinking they can watch Prime video and then they're going to be disappointed and they're going to return it now you're asking a question where I'll just say you know I think Private Business discussion should remain private nilai hey Jeff when the things I think that's most impressive that what you've done is run a public company for a very long time 
17:00-17:30
earning not that much money on a relative basis and today and start up land it feels like going public is something that companies don't want to do some Curious when you look at a company like Uber or something other startup to take on private the capital do you think if I've been in that situation I do exactly what you're doing or do you think just go public already it's actually not that bad that's a very and I think it's very case-specific so I think 
17:30-18:00
it's there's no one-size-fits-all answer I think these very large private companies in my opinion pie could go public with no it wouldn't hurt their freedom of movement at all and they Park sleep I could go part of what's happened is they also just may not see a need to go public so there are some great reasons to go public if you need to raise a lot of capital I mean really a lot it might be more effective to be public and the private Capital Market 
18:00-18:30
have gotten so large and that's a relatively new phenomenon that's happened just over the last couple of decades the private Capital markets and gotten so large that to some degree that argument has gone away the other reason you might want to go public as to offer employees liquidity I think that argument roommates now they're of course he's private liquidity markets that have sprung up to the satisfy that need but they don't do it as well as the public markets would so probably for the employees it would be better if the company's went Pub 
18:30-19:00
for the you know for the major sure owners might not be better to go post interest might not be perfectly aligned okay I think we have one more question my right you can't get Apple TV on Amazon by the way I just looked at good hardware for an online retailer you've certainly made a fair amount of Hardware but one category that we haven't seen Amazon really 
19:00-19:30
Turner is wearables in a lot of your competitors are so what are your thoughts on the current state of the wearables market and Missy can't talk about our future roadmap but I do think that I think that's also in its infancy I think you're going to see a bunch of different products be successful there in different functions and I don't think you've seen the tip of the iceberg 
19:30-20:00
something that Amazon is exploring not that I can talk to about questions product roadmap questions should generally not be answered you you I mean it would you didn't say no to say that oh no I would never say that 
20:00-20:30
I'm curious what you know if you were looking at a wearable would you be interested it from up payments perspective because some wearables now that you tap to pay because I want to see what come tell me your idea
